# Blockchain-as-the-new-Middleware
Abstract. Blockchain (i.e., DLTs) is well positioned to be the next middleware and/or Platform as a Service (PaaS) layer due to its decentralised nature and its unique attributes.

With the introduction of blockchain into the enterprise software landscape, the immediate task is to attempt to categorise within the likes of traditional confines such as 3-tier architecture and this is by no means an easy task -- should blockchain be categorise under Applications (SaaS), Middleware (PaaS) or Infrastructure (IaaS)? Presentation (Web), Application (Logic) or Data Tier?

Blockchain serves a dual role/function: both a data tier (distributed ledger containing shared transactions) and also an application tier due to smart contract (logic). Blockchain thus sits comfortably in the data tier and application tier.

With provenance as the goal and with its unifying capabilities across multiple nodes, blockchain is well positioned to transform and disrupt the enterprise software landscape.
